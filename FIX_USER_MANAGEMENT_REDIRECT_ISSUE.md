# Fix: User Management Redirecting to Document Settings

## Problem

When clicking on "User Management" tab, it immediately redirects to the Document Settings tab instead of showing the User Management screen.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by **outdated account_type check** in the permission validation logic.

### What Happened:

1. **Database Migration**: Account types were renamed from `'personal'/'corporate'` to `'individual'/'enterprise'`
2. **Code Not Updated**: The User Management page was still checking for `account_type !== 'corporate'`
3. **Check Failed**: Since the database now has `'enterprise'`, the check `account_type !== 'corporate'` was **always true**
4. **Redirect Triggered**: This caused an immediate redirect to `/settings/documents`

### The Bug:

**File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/users/page.tsx` (Line 64)

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Checking for old value 'corporate'
if (data.userProfile.account_type !== 'corporate') {
  router.replace('/settings/documents')
  return
}
```

**What was happening:**
- User's actual `account_type` in database: `'enterprise'`
- Code checking: `'enterprise' !== 'corporate'` → **TRUE**
- Result: Redirect to `/settings/documents` ❌

## Solution Applied

### Fix 1: Update Account Type Check ✅

**File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/users/page.tsx` (Line 64)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Check if user is corporate and has admin/owner role
if (data.userProfile.account_type !== 'corporate') {
  router.replace('/settings/documents')
  return
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Check if user is enterprise and has admin/owner role
if (data.userProfile.account_type !== 'enterprise') {
  router.replace('/settings/documents')
  return
}
```

### Fix 2: Update Error Message ✅

**File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/users/page.tsx` (Line 200)

**Before:**
```typescript
<p className="text-yellow-800">This page is only available for corporate account administrators.</p>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<p className="text-yellow-800">This page is only available for enterprise account administrators.</p>
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/users/page.tsx`
   - Line 64: Changed `'corporate'` to `'enterprise'`
   - Line 63: Updated comment from "corporate" to "enterprise"
   - Line 200: Updated error message from "corporate" to "enterprise"

## Verification

### Database Values (After Migration):
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT account_type FROM user_profiles;
-- Results:
-- 'individual'  (was 'personal')
-- 'enterprise'  (was 'corporate')
```

### Code Check:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Now checking for 'enterprise'
if (data.userProfile.account_type !== 'enterprise') {
  router.replace('/settings/documents')
  return
}
```

### Logic Flow:
1. User clicks "User Management"
2. Page loads, calls `/api/corporate/users`
3. Checks: `account_type !== 'enterprise'`
4. If user is enterprise admin/owner: ✅ Shows User Management page
5. If user is NOT enterprise: ❌ Redirects to Document Settings

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Enterprise Admin/Owner
1. Log in as enterprise admin (e.g., cmd@codeminds.digital)
2. Click "User Management" in sidebar
3. **Expected**: User Management page loads successfully
4. **Should NOT**: Redirect to Document Settings

### Test Case 2: Individual Account User
1. Log in as individual account user
2. Navigate to `/settings/users` directly
3. **Expected**: Redirects to Document Settings
4. **Reason**: Not an enterprise account

### Test Case 3: Enterprise Member (Not Admin)
1. Log in as enterprise member (not admin/owner)
2. Navigate to `/settings/users` directly
3. **Expected**: Redirects to Document Settings
4. **Reason**: Not an admin or owner

## Related Files

The same terminology change was already correctly applied in:
- ✅ `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/corporate/page.tsx` (Line 51) - Already using `'enterprise'`
- ✅ `src/app/api/corporate/settings/route.ts` (Line 154) - Already using `'enterprise'`
- ✅ Database migration: `database/migrations/rename_account_types.sql`

## Why This Happened

During the terminology change from "Corporate" to "Enterprise":
1. ✅ Database values were migrated correctly
2. ✅ Most API routes were updated correctly
3. ✅ Enterprise Settings page was updated correctly
4. ❌ **User Management page was missed** - still had old check

This is a common issue when doing find-and-replace migrations - some instances can be missed, especially when the old term appears in different contexts.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Search for all instances**: Use global search for old terms
   ```bash
   grep -r "account_type !== 'corporate'" src/
   grep -r "'corporate'" src/ | grep account_type
   ```

2. **Check both frontend and backend**: Ensure consistency
3. **Test all affected features**: Don't just test the main flow
4. **Use TypeScript enums**: Define account types as constants
   ```typescript
   export const AccountType = {
     INDIVIDUAL: 'individual',
     ENTERPRISE: 'enterprise'
   } as const
   ```

## Result

✅ **User Management now works correctly**
✅ **Enterprise admins can access User Management page**
✅ **Non-enterprise users are properly redirected**
✅ **Terminology is consistent throughout the app**

## Summary

The issue was a simple but critical oversight: the User Management page was still checking for the old `'corporate'` account type instead of the new `'enterprise'` value. This caused all users (even enterprise admins) to be redirected away from the page.

**One-line fix**: Changed `'corporate'` to `'enterprise'` in the account type check.
