## ✅ COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. Terminology Update: Personal → Individual, Corporate → Enterprise

**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE**

All references to "Personal" and "Corporate" have been updated to "Individual" and "Enterprise" throughout:

- ✅ **Frontend Components** (signup form, settings pages, sidebar)
- ✅ **Backend APIs** (all 7 corporate API routes)
- ✅ **Database** (Supabase migration executed successfully)
- ✅ **Documentation** (all markdown files updated)

### 2. Build Fixes

**Fixed Issues**:

1. ✅ Missing `Users` icon import in `sidebar.tsx`
2. ✅ TypeScript type errors in `corporate/settings/page.tsx` (added `as const`)
3. ✅ Supabase `generateLink` API errors (changed `type: 'signup'` to `type: 'magiclink'`)
4. ✅ Missing Suspense boundary in `verify-email/page.tsx`

## ✅ RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. Resend Verification Email Feature - NOW WORKING!

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND WORKING**

**Original Issue**: Webpack configuration bug in `next.config.js`

**Error Message** (before fix):
```
[Error: Cannot find module 'next-app-loader?page=%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fresend-verification%2Froute...']
> Build error occurred
[Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/auth/resend-verification]
```

**Root Cause Discovered**:
The issue was NOT a Next.js bug, but a configuration error in `next.config.js`!

Line 71 had: `request.includes('resend')`

This was matching ANY request path containing the word "resend", including route paths like `/api/auth/resend-verification`, and incorrectly externalizing them as if they were the `resend` npm package!

**Investigation Process**:

1. **Tested minimal routes** - Even a simple test route with "resend" in the path failed
2. **Tested without "resend"** - Routes named "reverify" or "test-email-again" worked fine
3. **Discovered the pattern** - ANY route path containing "resend" failed
4. **Found the culprit** - `next.config.js` line 71: `request.includes('resend')`

**The Fix**:

Changed in `next.config.js`:
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
if (request && (
  request.includes('react-email') ||
  request.includes('next/document') ||
  request.includes('resend') ||  // ❌ This matches route paths too!
  request === 'resend' ||
  request.startsWith('@react-email/')
)) {
  return callback(null, `commonjs ${request}`);
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
if (request && (
  request.includes('react-email') ||
  request.includes('next/document') ||
  request === 'resend' ||  // ✅ Only exact match, not includes!
  request.startsWith('@react-email/')
)) {
  return callback(null, `commonjs ${request}`);
}
```

**What Changed**:
- Removed `request.includes('resend')`
- Kept only `request === 'resend'` for exact package name matching
- This prevents route paths like `/api/auth/resend-verification` from being incorrectly externalized

**Result**: ✅ **ALL ROUTES NOW WORK!**

**Implemented Features**:

1. ✅ **API Route**: `/api/auth/resend-verification`
   - Validates email format
   - Checks if user exists
   - Checks if email is already verified
   - Rate limiting: 1 email per 24 hours
   - Token validity: 15 minutes
   - Security: Doesn't reveal if user exists

2. ✅ **Resend Verification Popup**
   - Shows when user tries to login with unverified email
   - Clean UI with success/error messages
   - Integrated with login form

3. ✅ **Files Updated**:
   - `next.config.js` - Fixed webpack externals configuration
   - `src/app/api/auth/resend-verification/route.ts` - Full implementation
   - `src/components/features/auth/resend-verification-popup.tsx` - Updated API endpoint
   - `src/components/features/auth/login-form.tsx` - Re-enabled popup

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS

### Recommended Testing:
1. **Test Resend Verification Feature**:
   - Create a new user account
   - Try to login before verifying email
   - Verify the resend popup appears
   - Test the rate limiting (1 email per 24 hours)
   - Verify the email is sent and link works

2. **Test All Features**:
   - Individual signup and login
   - Enterprise signup and login
   - TOTP authentication
   - Enterprise settings and user management

### Optional Improvements:
1. **Clean Up ESLint Warnings**:
   - Some unused variables prefixed with `_`
   - Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
   - These are warnings, not errors, and don't affect functionality

2. **Database Rate Limiting** (Production):
   - Current rate limiting uses in-memory Map
   - For production, consider using Redis or database table
   - This will persist rate limits across server restarts
