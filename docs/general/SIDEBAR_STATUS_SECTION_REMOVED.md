## 🎯 **RATIONALE**

### **Why Remove Status Section?**

1. **Redundancy**: Status information is already displayed prominently in the Dashboard with the unified card system
2. **Consistency**: Aligns with the unified card approach where all status information is centralized
3. **User Experience**: Reduces navigation complexity and focuses on primary actions
4. **Maintenance**: Eliminates the need to maintain count synchronization between sidebar and dashboard

### **User Journey Improvement**
- Users now see comprehensive status information in the Dashboard cards
- Click-to-filter functionality provides better interaction than separate status pages
- Cleaner navigation focuses on document workflows rather than status management

## ✅ **VERIFICATION**

### **Sidebar Now Contains:**
- ✅ Core navigation (Dashboard, Sign Inbox, Drive, etc.)
- ✅ Settings section
- ✅ Development tools
- ❌ No status section with counts

### **Status Information Available In:**
- ✅ Dashboard unified status cards
- ✅ Click-to-filter functionality
- ✅ Individual document status indicators

## 🎉 **RESULT**

**The sidebar is now cleaner and more focused, with status information properly centralized in the Dashboard's unified card system. This creates a better user experience with less redundancy and clearer information architecture.**

The change aligns perfectly with the unified card system approach, where the Dashboard serves as the central hub for all status information and navigation.
