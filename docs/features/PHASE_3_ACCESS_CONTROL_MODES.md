# Phase 3: Access Control Modes - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Overview

Corporate admins and owners can now control how users from their email domain join the enterprise account through a beautiful settings interface with three access modes.

---

## 🎯 Three Access Modes

### **1. Open Mode** 🟢
**Auto-approve users with matching email domain**

**How it works:**
- User signs up with enterprise email (e.g., `user@acme.com`)
- Domain check: Corporate account exists
- Access mode: `open`
- ✅ User automatically added as **Member**
- ✅ Immediate access after email verification
- ✅ No admin approval needed

**Best for:**
- Trusted internal teams
- Small companies
- Organizations with secure email domains

**Warning:**
- Anyone with your email domain can join
- Make sure your domain is secure

---

### **2. Approval Mode** 🔵
**Users request access, admin approves**

**How it works:**
- User signs up with enterprise email
- Domain check: Corporate account exists
- Access mode: `approval`
- 📝 Access request created in `corporate_access_requests` table
- 👤 User created with `account_status: 'suspended'`
- ⏳ User sees "Pending Approval" page
- 📧 Admin receives notification (Phase 5)
- ✅ Admin approves → User can log in
- ❌ Admin declines → User cannot log in

**Best for:**
- Medium-sized organizations
- Balanced security and flexibility
- Teams that want control but not too restrictive

**Warning:**
- You must manually approve each request
- Users wait until approved

---

### **3. Invite-Only Mode** 🟣
**Only invited users can join (most secure)**

**How it works:**
- User tries to sign up with enterprise email
- Domain check: Corporate account exists
- Access mode: `invite_only`
- 🚫 Signup blocked completely
- 💬 Message: "Contact your administrator for an invitation"
- 📧 Admin sends invitation (Phase 4)
- 🔗 User receives invitation email with token
- ✅ User clicks link and completes signup
- ✅ Access granted immediately

**Best for:**
- Sensitive organizations
- Maximum security and control
- Regulated industries
- Selective team building

**Warning:**
- Users cannot signup on their own
- You must invite them manually

## 🔄 How Access Modes Work

### **Database Flow:**

```sql
-- Corporate account stores access mode
SELECT access_mode FROM corporate_accounts WHERE email_domain = 'acme.com';
-- Returns: 'open' | 'approval' | 'invite_only'

-- Signup checks access mode
1. User signs up with email@acme.com
2. Check corporate_accounts.access_mode
3. Apply rules based on mode:
   - open → Create user as member, status='active'
   - approval → Create user, status='suspended', create access_request
   - invite_only → Block signup, show error
```

### **API Flow:**

```
User Signup
    ↓
POST /api/corporate/signup
    ↓
Check domain → corporate_accounts
    ↓
Get access_mode
    ↓
┌─────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│  Open   │   Approval   │ Invite-Only  │
├─────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Create  │ Create user  │ Block signup │
│ user as │ suspended    │ Return error │
│ member  │ Create       │              │
│ Active  │ request      │              │
└─────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```
