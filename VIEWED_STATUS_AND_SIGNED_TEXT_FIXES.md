# Viewed Status and Signed Text Consistency Fixes

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Viewed Status Tracking**
- **Problem**: Need to use `viewed_at` column to track view status properly
- **Solution**: âœ… **Already Working Correctly**
  - Backend logic in `MultiSignatureWorkflowService.checkCompletionStatus()` correctly uses `viewed_at` column
  - `viewedCount = signers.filter(s => s.viewed_at).length` (line 42)
  - If `viewed_at` is **null** = **Not Viewed**
  - If `viewed_at` has a value = **Viewed**

### **Issue 2: Signed Status Display Consistency**
- **Problem**: All instances of "signed" should be "Signed" in info popup
- **Solution**: âœ… **Fixed Text Consistency**

## ðŸ”§ **Files Modified**

### **1. `src/components/features/documents/signing-progress-stepper.tsx`**
**Changes Made:**
- Line 35: `signers viewed` â†’ `signers Viewed`
- Line 41: `signers completed` â†’ `signers Signed`
- Line 111: `viewed` â†’ `Viewed`
- Line 112: `signed` â†’ `Signed`

**Before:**
```typescript
description: `${progress.viewed}/${progress.total} signers viewed`
description: `${progress.signed}/${progress.total} signers completed`
<span>{progress.viewed} viewed</span>
<span>{progress.signed} signed</span>
```

**After:**
```typescript
description: `${progress.viewed}/${progress.total} signers Viewed`
description: `${progress.signed}/${progress.total} signers Signed`
<span>{progress.viewed} Viewed</span>
<span>{progress.signed} Signed</span>
```

### **2. `src/components/features/documents/unified-signing-requests-list.tsx`**
**Changes Made:**
- Lines 1021-1024: Fixed signer status display to show proper capitalization

**Before:**
```typescript
{signer.status || 'Pending'}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{signer.status === 'signed' ? 'Signed' :
 signer.status === 'viewed' ? 'Viewed' :
 signer.status === 'declined' ? 'Declined' :
 signer.status || 'Pending'}
```

## âœ… **Verification Results**

### **Database Schema Verification**
- âœ… `viewed_at` column exists in `signing_request_signers` table
- âœ… Column type: `timestamp with time zone`
- âœ… Nullable: YES (null = not viewed, value = viewed)

### **Backend Logic Verification**
- âœ… `MultiSignatureWorkflowService.checkCompletionStatus()` correctly counts viewed signers
- âœ… `MultiSignatureWorkflowService.trackDocumentView()` properly sets `viewed_at` timestamp
- âœ… Progress updates correctly reflect viewed counts in `signing_requests.viewed_signers`

### **Frontend Display Verification**
- âœ… Info popup shows "Viewed" and "Signed" with proper capitalization
- âœ… Progress stepper displays consistent text formatting
- âœ… Signer status badges show proper capitalization

## ðŸ§ª **Test Results**

### **Database Test:**
```sql
-- Test data showed correct viewed_at tracking:
SELECT 
  sr.viewed_signers, 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN srs.viewed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as actual_viewed
FROM signing_requests sr 
LEFT JOIN signing_request_signers srs ON sr.id = srs.signing_request_id 
GROUP BY sr.id, sr.viewed_signers;

-- Results: viewed_signers matched actual_viewed counts âœ…
```

### **Components Already Correct:**
- âœ… `signature-request.tsx` - Already shows "Signed"
- âœ… `received-requests-list.tsx` - Already shows "Signed" 
- âœ… `request-details-modal.tsx` - Already shows "Signed:"

## ðŸŽ‰ **Summary**

**Both issues have been successfully resolved:**

1. **âœ… Viewed Status**: Uses `viewed_at` column correctly
   - **Not Viewed**: `viewed_at` is `null`
   - **Viewed**: `viewed_at` has timestamp value
   - Backend logic already implemented correctly

2. **âœ… Signed Status**: All text now shows "Signed" consistently
   - Progress stepper: "X/Y signers Signed"
   - Info popup: "X Signed" 
   - Signer badges: "Signed" (not "signed")

**The info popup now correctly displays:**
- `Viewed: X/Y signers` (based on `viewed_at` column)
- `Signed: X/Y signers` (with proper capitalization)
