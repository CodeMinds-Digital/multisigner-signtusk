# 🔧 Auth Import Error Fix

## ❌ **Problem**
When clicking "Accept & Sign" for parallel signing, the application was throwing this error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/auth-utils'
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The newly created `validate-sequential` API route was using incorrect import paths:
```typescript
// ❌ Incorrect imports
import { getAuthTokensFromRequest, verifyAccessToken } from '@/lib/auth-utils'
```

The `@/lib/auth-utils` module doesn't exist in the codebase.

## ✅ **Solution**
Fixed the imports to use the correct paths that all other API routes use:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct imports
import { getAuthTokensFromRequest } from '@/lib/auth-cookies'
import { verifyAccessToken } from '@/lib/jwt-utils'
```

## 📋 **File Fixed**
- `src/app/api/signature-requests/validate-sequential/route.ts`

## 🧪 **Expected Result**
- ✅ Parallel signing "Accept & Sign" button now works
- ✅ Sequential signing validation works properly
- ✅ No more module resolution errors
- ✅ All signing workflows function correctly

## 🔍 **How This Was Identified**
By examining existing API routes in the codebase, I found that all other routes use:
- `getAuthTokensFromRequest` from `@/lib/auth-cookies`
- `verifyAccessToken` from `@/lib/jwt-utils`

This is the standard pattern used throughout the application for authentication in API routes.

The error occurred because when I created the new validation endpoint, I mistakenly used a non-existent import path instead of following the established pattern.
