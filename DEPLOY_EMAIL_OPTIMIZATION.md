- [ ] Have Supabase dashboard access ready

---

## 🎯 **Step-by-Step Deployment**

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration (5 minutes)**

#### **Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `signtuskfinal` or `archaan`

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy Migration SQL**
   - Open: `database/migrations/add_email_preference_columns.sql`
   - Copy entire contents

4. **Run Migration**
   - Paste SQL into editor
   - Click "Run" button
   - Wait for success message

5. **Verify**
   - You should see: "Email preference columns added successfully!"
   - Check for any errors

#### **Option B: Supabase CLI**

```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
supabase db push
```

---

### **Step 2: Test Locally (5 minutes)**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/naveenselvam/Desktop/ai_pair_programming/multisigner-signtusk

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

**Test the changes:**

1. **Open browser:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Login** to your account
3. **Navigate to:** Settings > Email Preferences
4. **Verify:**
   - Page loads without errors
   - All toggles are visible
   - Defaults are correct:
     - ✅ Email Notifications: ON
     - ✅ Signature Requests: ON
     - ✅ Reminders: ON
     - ✅ Document Updates: ON
     - ✅ Progress Updates: ON
     - ❌ Document Viewed Emails: OFF
     - ❌ Other Signer Notifications: OFF
   - Toggle switches work
   - Changes save successfully

---

### **Step 3: Deploy to Production (5 minutes)**

#### **If using Netlify:**

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Phase 1 email optimization - reduce volume by 40%"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically deploy.

#### **If using Vercel:**

```bash
# Same as above
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Phase 1 email optimization - reduce volume by 40%"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy.

#### **Manual deployment:**

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy using your preferred method
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify Production (2 minutes)**

1. **Visit your production URL**
   - Example: https://your-app.netlify.app

2. **Login** to your account

3. **Navigate to:** Settings > Email Preferences

4. **Verify:**
   - Page loads correctly
   - No console errors
   - Toggles work
   - Changes save

5. **Test email sending:**
   - Create a test signature request
   - Verify initial email is sent
   - View the document
   - Verify NO "document viewed" email is sent ✅

---

## 🧪 **Post-Deployment Testing**

### **Test 1: New User Defaults**

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM notification_preferences 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

**Expected:**
- `document_viewed_emails`: false
- `other_signer_notifications`: false
- `progress_updates`: true

### **Test 2: Email Volume**

Create a test document with 3 signers and track emails:

**Before optimization:**
- Initial requests: 3 emails
- Document viewed: 3 emails ❌
- Signature progress: 6 emails ❌
- Completion: 4 emails
- **Total: 16 emails**

**After optimization:**
- Initial requests: 3 emails
- Document viewed: 0 emails ✅
- Signature progress: 0 emails ✅
- Completion: 4 emails
- **Total: 7 emails (-56%!)** 🎉

---

## 📊 **Monitoring**

### **Check Email Volume (Daily)**

```sql
-- Count emails sent today
SELECT 
  DATE(sent_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_emails,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE type = 'document_viewed') as viewed_emails,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE type = 'signature_request_signed') as progress_emails
FROM notification_logs
WHERE sent_at >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY DATE(sent_at);
```

### **Check User Preferences (Weekly)**

```sql
-- See how many users have customized preferences
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE email_notifications = false) as disabled_all,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE document_viewed_emails = true) as enabled_viewed,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE other_signer_notifications = true) as enabled_progress,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE email_notifications = false) / COUNT(*), 2) as pct_disabled
FROM notification_preferences;
```

### **Resend Dashboard**

1. Go to: https://resend.com/dashboard
2. Check:
   - Total emails sent (should decrease)
   - Open rate (should increase)
   - Spam complaints (should decrease)

---

## 🚨 **Rollback Plan (If Needed)**

If something goes wrong:

### **Option 1: Revert Database Changes**

```sql
-- Remove new columns
ALTER TABLE notification_preferences
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS progress_updates,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS document_viewed_emails,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS other_signer_notifications;
```

### **Option 2: Revert Code Changes**

```bash
# Revert the commit
git revert HEAD

# Push to trigger redeployment
git push origin main
```

### **Option 3: Enable All Emails Temporarily**

```sql
-- Enable all email types for all users
UPDATE notification_preferences
SET 
  document_viewed_emails = true,
  other_signer_notifications = true,
  progress_updates = true;
```

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Email volume reduced by 15-40%
- [ ] No user complaints about missing emails
- [ ] Settings page working correctly
- [ ] No errors in application logs
