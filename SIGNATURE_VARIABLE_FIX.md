# 🔧 Signature Variable Error Fix

## ❌ **Problem**
When clicking "Accept & Sign" for parallel signing mode, the application was throwing this error:
```
ReferenceError: signerEmail is not defined
at POST (src/app/api/signature-requests/sign/route.ts:216:7)
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Issue 1: Undefined Variable `signerEmail`**
The code was trying to use `signerEmail` but the variable was actually defined as `userEmail`:
```typescript
// Line 21: Variable defined as userEmail
const userEmail = payload.email

// Line 216: Incorrectly using signerEmail (undefined)
const completionResult = await MultiSignatureWorkflowService.handleSignerCompletion(
  requestId,
  signerEmail  // ❌ This variable doesn't exist
)
```

### **Issue 2: Undefined Variable `documentStatus`**
The response was trying to return `documentStatus` which was never defined:
```typescript
return new Response(
  JSON.stringify({
    success: true,
    message: 'Signature saved successfully',
    signedCount,
    totalSigners,
    allSignersCompleted,
    documentStatus  // ❌ This variable doesn't exist
  }),
  // ...
)
```

## ✅ **Solutions Applied**

### **1. Fixed Variable Name**
```typescript
// Before
const completionResult = await MultiSignatureWorkflowService.handleSignerCompletion(
  requestId,
  signerEmail  // ❌ Undefined
)

// After
const completionResult = await MultiSignatureWorkflowService.handleSignerCompletion(
  requestId,
  userEmail  // ✅ Correctly defined variable
)
```

### **2. Fixed Response Data**
```typescript
// Before
return new Response(
  JSON.stringify({
    success: true,
    message: 'Signature saved successfully',
    signedCount,
    totalSigners,
    allSignersCompleted,
    documentStatus  // ❌ Undefined
  }),
  // ...
)

// After
return new Response(
  JSON.stringify({
    success: true,
    message: 'Signature saved successfully',
    signedCount,
    totalSigners,
    allSignersCompleted: completionResult.allCompleted,  // ✅ From completion result
    finalPdfUrl: completionResult.finalPdfUrl,           // ✅ From completion result
    nextSignerEmail: completionResult.nextSignerEmail    // ✅ From completion result
  }),
  // ...
)
```

## 📋 **File Fixed**
- `src/app/api/signature-requests/sign/route.ts`

## 🧪 **Expected Results**
- ✅ **Parallel signing**: "Accept & Sign" button now works without errors
- ✅ **Sequential signing**: Also works correctly
- ✅ **API response**: Returns proper completion data including:
  - Final PDF URL (when all signers complete)
  - Next signer email (for sequential mode)
  - Completion status
- ✅ **No more 500 errors**: Server responds correctly

## 🔍 **How This Happened**
This was a simple variable naming inconsistency that occurred during the recent multi-signature workflow refactoring. The variable was correctly defined as `userEmail` at the top of the function, but when calling the completion handler, it was mistakenly referred to as `signerEmail`.

The `documentStatus` issue was also a leftover from previous code that wasn't properly updated when the response structure was modified.

## 🎯 **Prevention**
- Use consistent variable naming throughout functions
- Ensure all variables in return statements are properly defined
- Test API endpoints after making changes to catch undefined variable errors early
